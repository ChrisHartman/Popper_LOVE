This is a simple game that I created using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. 

##How to Run
This repository contains the source code to build the project using love, along with a .love file to create a mac app or executable file, and popper.zip, which holds the mac app.

###OS X
The mac app is located inside of popper.zip. Unzip the folder and open the app. If you get an unidentified developer error and there is no button to open the app, try right clicking the app and selecting "open". This should offer the same dialog except with a button to open the app anyway.

###Windows

Follow instructions on [the LÖVE wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) starting with creating a game executable (the .love file is included in the repo)





##How to Play
Use the right and left arrow keys to move the large spike ball clockwise and counter clockwise, respectively. The goal is to have each falling ball fall on spikes of the same color. Each ball on the correct color is worth one point. You are allowed three misses. After that, the game will display "Game Over" along with your final score. Hitting the return key will start the game over.
