This is a simple game that I created using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. 

##How to Run
This repository contains the source code to build Popper using love, along with a .love file that can be used to package the game in different ways, and popper.zip, which holds a mac app version of the game.

###OS X
The mac app is located inside of popper.zip. Unzip the folder and open the app. If you get an unidentified developer error and there is no button to open the app, try right clicking the app and selecting "open". This should offer the same dialog except with a button to open the app anyway.

###Windows or Linux

Follow instructions on [the LÖVE wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) starting with creating a game executable (the .love file is included in the repo)

##How to Play
Use the right and left arrow keys to move the large spike ball clockwise and counter clockwise, respectively. The goal is to have each falling ball fall on spikes of the same color. Each ball on the correct color is worth one point. You are allowed three misses, and then the game is over. Hitting the return key or space bar will start the game again once you hit the game over screen.
